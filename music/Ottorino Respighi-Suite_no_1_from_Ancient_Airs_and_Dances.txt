Ancient Airs and Dances (Antiche arie e danze) is a set of three orchestral suites by Ottorino Respighi. In addition to being a renowned composer and conductor, Respighi was also a notable musicologist, and his interest in Italian music of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries led him to compose works inspired by the music of these periods. Suite no. 1 was composed in 1917. It was based on Renaissance lute pieces by Simone Molinaro, Vincenzo Galilei (father of Galileo Galilei) and additional anonymous composers.
