Convergence is an ongoing experiment for me. The idea is to take synthetic and organic sounds (that aren't often brought together) into the same space as if they were a part of a small band. 
The rhythm sections in Convergence keep tightly  in sync as the melodies and arpeggios flow over them. I've spent the greater part of a year and a half writing these pieces and they truly 
have been a big part of my life (getting me through some really tough days). My greatest hope is to have someone listen to my music on a terrible day and help them let go of the stress that 
plagues them. Convergence is a personal statement for me as a self taught composer, producer, and computer repair technician. My belief is that every single person in this world has the 
potential to create and explore new territory whether or not they could afford college or were born into the right family. I also believe that "piracy" gives people the freedom to really 
experience a product before they buy. As a truly independent composer (with absolutely no record label) I have the ability to put that in my music's description.  Thank you to everyone who 
chooses to listen, purchase, or share my music. 


If you find my music to be worth paying for, please consider sending me some crypto or purchasing it through one of the digital distribution stores.
